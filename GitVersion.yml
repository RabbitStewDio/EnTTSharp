#
# Defines the GitVersion model this project is using. 
#
# 5 Minutes overview: 
#     http://gitversion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/git-branching-strategies/gitflow-examples/
# 
# Summary:
#   - Development happens in the "develop" branch
#   - Releases go into the "master" branch
#     - stabilisation, if needed happens in "release-x.y.z" branches
#     - long term support for releases is branched off master as needed. 
#       This is where ongoing patches for older versions are developed.
#      - "support-dev-1.x" for developing the changes.
#      - "support-1.x" is used for the releases
#
